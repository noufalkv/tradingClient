# Reactotron 426 Error - Explanation & Solution

## üîç What's the 426 Error?

**HTTP 426 - "Upgrade Required"** is expected and **NOT an error** in Reactotron's case.

### Why You See 426:
- Reactotron requires **WebSocket** connection (not plain HTTP)
- When something tries to access `http://localhost:9090` with regular HTTP, it responds with 426
- This tells the client: "You need to upgrade to WebSocket protocol"

### Where 426 Appears:
- üî¥ Browser console when you open http://localhost:9090 in browser
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Network requests tab showing failed requests
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Any tool trying to access Reactotron via HTTP instead of WebSocket

## ‚úÖ This is Normal & Expected

The React Native app **connects correctly** via WebSocket (not HTTP), so:
- Your app connection works fine
- Network monitoring works fine
- Debugging works fine
- **426 error is harmless**

Think of it like an error message that says: "If you want to talk to me, upgrade your protocol" - the app already has the right protocol, so it works!

## üéØ How to Use Reactotron Correctly

### Method 1: Desktop App (Recommended)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Metro bundler
npm start

# Terminal 2: Build and run app
npm run android

# Terminal 3: Start Reactotron
reactotron
```

The desktop app handles the WebSocket upgrade automatically. No 426 errors in your face.

### Method 2: Browser Console
**Don't** open `http://localhost:9090` in browser for viewing data. Use the **desktop app** instead.

If you do open it in browser, the 426 is expected.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If Network Calls Don't Show:

1. **Check Reactotron is Running**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :9090
   ```
   Should show: `Reactotron ... (LISTEN)`

2. **Check Port Forwarding**
   ```bash
   adb reverse tcp:9090 tcp:9090
   ```

3. **Check Metro Bundler**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Restart Everything**
   ```bash
   # Kill all
   pkill -f "reactotron"
   pkill -f "node"
   npm run android
   reactotron
   ```

### If 426 Error Bothers You:

It's harmless, but if you want to suppress it:

1. **In Browser DevTools**: Disable console messages from certain sources
2. **In Reactotron App**: It doesn't show this error
3. **Use Desktop App**: No browser, no 426 errors!

## üìä Real Usage Flow

```
Your Machine          Device (Samsung)
    ‚Üì                      ‚Üì
[Reactotron] ‚óÑ--WebSocket--‚ñ∫ [React Native App]
Port 9090                   (Connected via ADB)
```

The connection is **WebSocket**, not HTTP. So:
- ‚úÖ Real-time communication works
- ‚úÖ Network requests appear instantly
- ‚úÖ Logs stream in real-time
- ‚úÖ No 426 errors in the flow (only when trying HTTP)

## üéØ How to View Network Calls (Correctly)

1. **Open Reactotron Desktop App**
   ```bash
   reactotron
   ```

2. **Click "Network" tab** in the app

3. **Use Your React Native App** (make API calls)

4. **Watch Network Tab** for requests to appear

5. **Click Any Request** to see full details

No browser needed, no 426 errors!

## üì± Example: Testing Network Monitoring

### Step 1: Start Everything
```bash
# Terminal 1
npm start

# Terminal 2
npm run android

# Terminal 3
reactotron
```

### Step 2: In Reactotron App
- Look for "Network" or "Networking" tab
- Leave it open and visible

### Step 3: In Your Phone
- Open the app (should launch automatically)
- Go to login screen
- Enter credentials
- Submit form

### Step 4: In Reactotron
- Watch the POST request appear in Network tab
- Click it to see full request/response

## üöÄ Success Indicators

‚úÖ Reactotron Desktop App opens without errors
‚úÖ Network tab exists and is empty initially
‚úÖ When you make API calls, requests appear
‚úÖ You can click requests to see details
‚úÖ Response bodies are visible and readable

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

‚ùå Opening http://localhost:9090 in browser expecting UI
   ‚Üí Get 426 error
   ‚Üí Use Reactotron desktop app instead

‚ùå Checking browser console for app logs
   ‚Üí Won't show app logs there
   ‚Üí Use Reactotron app's Logs tab instead

‚ùå Expecting HTTP connection to work
   ‚Üí Reactotron uses WebSocket
   ‚Üí Use desktop app for proper connection

## üí° Pro Tip

**The 426 error is actually a feature!** It means:
- ‚úÖ Reactotron server is running
- ‚úÖ It's rejecting improper HTTP requests
- ‚úÖ It only accepts proper WebSocket connections
- ‚úÖ Your app is using proper WebSocket protocol

Think of it as a security feature - the server says "No HTTP here, WebSocket only!"

## Summary

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **426 Error Meaning** | Server requires WebSocket (normal) |
| **App Connection** | Uses WebSocket (works fine) |
| **Error Impact** | None - purely informational |
| **How to View Data** | Use Reactotron desktop app |
| **Where to Check** | Network tab in Reactotron UI |
| **Browser Usage** | Not needed for debugging |

**Status**: ‚úÖ Everything working as expected
**Setup**: Complete
**Next**: Make API calls and watch them appear in Reactotron!
