## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Keystore
```bash
# If you don't have a keystore yet:
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/trading_app_keystore.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -alias trading_app_key

# Copy to project:
cp ~/trading_app_keystore.jks android/app/
```

### Step 2: Encode Keystore for GitHub
```bash
# Run the encoder script
./encode-keystore.sh

# Output will be Base64 encoded and copied to clipboard
```

### Step 3: Add GitHub Secrets
```
1. Go to GitHub repo
2. Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Click "New repository secret" for each:
   - KEYSTORE_FILE: [paste Base64]
   - KEYSTORE_PASSWORD: [your password]
   - KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD: [your password]
   - PLAYSTORE_CREDENTIALS: [Google JSON]
```

### Step 4: Deploy
```bash
# Push to main branch
git push origin main

# Workflow runs automatically!
```

### Step 5: Monitor
```
1. Go to GitHub → Actions tab
2. Watch "CI and CD" workflow
3. Check each step:
   - ✅ Setup credentials
   - ✅ Install dependencies
   - ✅ Set up Ruby
   - ✅ Deploy to Play Store
4. View logs if any step fails
```

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Store keystore file locally (not in Git)
- Use strong passwords (12+ characters)
- Keep GitHub Secrets secure
- Rotate credentials periodically
- Backup keystore to secure location
- Use `.gitignore` for sensitive files

❌ **DON'T:**
- Commit keystore file to Git
- Commit gradle.properties to Git
- Share keystore file via email
- Use weak passwords
- Store credentials in code
- Commit Base64 keystore to Git
