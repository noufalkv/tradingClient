# ✅ Flipper Integration - Issue Resolution

## 🔧 Issue Resolved

**Problem:** App was crashing after Flipper integration  
**Root Cause:** Flipper dependencies were not properly configured  
**Solution:** Temporarily commented out Flipper initialization

---

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed

### Before (Causing Crash)
```kotlin
override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    SoLoader.init(this, false)
    initializeFlipper(this, "com.rn_trading_app")  // ❌ Causing crash
    loadReactNative(this)
}
```

### After (Working)
```kotlin
override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    SoLoader.init(this, false)
    // initializeFlipper(this, "com.rn_trading_app")  // ✅ Commented out temporarily
    loadReactNative(this)
}
```
