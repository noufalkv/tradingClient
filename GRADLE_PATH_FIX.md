# 🔧 Gradle Path Fix - Fastlane

## Issue Resolved

**Error:** `Couldn't find gradlew at path '/home/runner/work/tradingClient/tradingClient/android/app/gradlew'`

**Root Cause:** The `project_dir: "app/"` parameter was telling gradle to look for gradlew in the wrong location

**Location of gradlew:**
```
android/
├── gradlew          ← CORRECT (gradle wrapper is here)
├── app/
│   ├── build.gradle
│   └── [no gradlew here]
└── ...
```

---

## What Changed

### Before (❌ Wrong Path)
```ruby
gradle(
  task: "bundle",
  build_type: "Release",
  project_dir: "app/"    ❌ Looks in android/app/gradlew
)
```

### After (✅ Correct)
```ruby
gradle(
  task: "bundle",
  build_type: "Release"
)
```

---

## Why This Works

When `project_dir` is not specified, fastlane:
1. ✅ Starts in the `android/` directory (from `working-directory` in workflow)
2. ✅ Finds `gradlew` in the correct location (`android/gradlew`)
3. ✅ Executes the gradle bundle task

---

## File Modified

`android/fastlane/Fastfile`

Changed the `playstore` lane to remove the incorrect `project_dir` parameter.

## How Fastlane Works

### Workflow Path Resolution

```
GitHub Actions Workflow
├── working-directory: android
│   └─ gradle(
│      └─ Looks for: ./gradlew (finds it! ✅)
│      └─ Runs: ./gradlew bundle (in android/)
└─ Result: Builds android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

### With project_dir: "app/"
```
├── working-directory: android
│   └─ gradle(project_dir: "app/"
│      └─ Looks for: ./app/gradlew (NOT FOUND! ❌)
│      └─ Error: Couldn't find gradlew
```

---

## Expected Workflow Now

When you deploy:

```
✅ Deploy to Google Play Store (working-directory: android)
   └─ Create credentials JSON
   └─ bundle exec fastlane playstore
      ├─ gradle(task: "bundle", build_type: "Release")
      │  └─ Finds: ./gradlew (✅ Found!)
      │  └─ Runs: ./gradlew bundleRelease
      │  └─ Builds: AAB file
      └─ upload_to_play_store(track: "internal")
         └─ Uploads to Google Play Console
```

## Android Project Structure

```
.
├── android/                         ← working-directory
│   ├── gradlew                      ← HERE (used by gradle action)
│   ├── gradle.properties            ← Signing config
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── build.gradle             ← App build config
│   │   ├── src/                     ← Source code
│   │   └── build/
│   │       └── outputs/
│   │           └── bundle/
│   │               └── release/
│   │                   └── app-release.aab  ← Output
│   └── fastlane/
│       ├── Fastfile                 ← (FIXED)
│       └── playstore-credentials.json
└── ...
```

## Summary

| What | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Gradle Path** | `./app/gradlew` ❌ | `./gradlew` ✅ |
| **Status** | "Couldn't find gradlew" ❌ | Ready to build ✅ |
| **Fix Applied** | No | Yes |
